# SelectionPanel - An App created for the ADA Hackathon 2020

App created for ADA Hackathon!

Steps to get it working:

1. yarn install 
2. yarn start
3. ngrok.exe http 9008 -host-header=localhost

Note: You must run ngrok on another terminal (yarn and ngrok must be running concurrently). You'll need to update the URL in the Ada App generated by ngrok since it updates each time you open the port. You shouldn't have to do this *too* much since the localhost server should update as you make changes to the code.

# Alternative Panels
You can switch to the alternative-panels branch to look at the code for the retail and location panels!

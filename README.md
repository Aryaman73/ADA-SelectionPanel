# SelectionPanel

App created for ADA Hackathon!

Steps to get it working after cloning the repository:

1. yarn install 
2. yarn start
3. ngrok.exe http 9008 --host-header=localhost (varies depending on OS)
4. Copy URL to App URL

Note: You must run ngrok on another terminal (yarn and ngrok must be running concurrently). You'll need to update the URL in the Ada App generated by ngrok since it updates each time you open the port. You shouldn't have to do this *too* much since the localhost server should update as you make changes to the code.

# Alternative Panels
You can switch to the alternative-panels branch to look at the code for the retail and location panels! Note that the ADA Bot is only meant to be used with master (Koodo Phone Plan), so the bot messages wouldn't make much sense with alternative-panels. 

## Technical Stack
The app uses the ADA Template, which uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the ADA SDK. We used MaterializeCSS to design the item carousel, along with Material-UI icons by Google.
